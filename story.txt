Tobias woke to the screeching of his alarm clock, today will be the day he takes the gold in the wettbewerbsfaehig gebaeck bake off.

He then took a bite of his Apfelkuchen and decided to head to the bake off in his Porsche along the Hauptstrasse.

And on the way to Berlin, he saw another driver wanting to race with his M5 BMW.

Then he try to talk to the driver but it was Hund. 

The hund was wearing a dirndel and smirked at Tobias. 

The Hund tore apart Tobias' dirndel.

When he went back to his car to door was schloss.

While standing by the car, he decided to get some beer from the Biergarten.

On the way to Biergarten, he saw Mehlhase in Baeckeret and he decided to buy it. 

He bought the Mehlhase and on he wanted to got some Gebaeck and Apfelkuchen.

Tired from the day and all the carbs, Tobias decided to grab a bratwurst.

After Tobias ate the bratwurst, he washed it down with a nice cold wurzelbier.

He soon fell schlafend in his bett.
